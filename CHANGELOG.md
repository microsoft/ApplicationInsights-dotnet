- BASE: Updated solution to build on Mac!

## Version 2.5.0-beta1
- BASE: Method `Sanitize` on classes implementing `ITelemetry` no longer modifies the `TelemetryContext` fields. Serialized event json and ETW event will still have context tags sanitized.
- BASE: Application Insights SDK supports multiple telemetry sinks. You can configure more than one channel for telemetry now.
- BASE: New method `DeepClone` on `ITelemetry` interface. Implemented by all supported telemetry items.
- BASE: Server telemetry channel NuGet support a netstandard1.3 target with fixed rate sampling and adaptive sampling telemetry processors.
- BASE: Instrumentation key is no longer required for TelemetryClient to send data to channel(s). This makes it easier to use the SDK with channels other than native Application Insights channels.
- BASE: .NET 4.0 targets were removed. Please use the version 2.4.0 if you cannot upgrade your application to the latest framework version.
- BASE: Removed `wp8`, `portable-win81+wpa81` and `uap10.0` targets.

## Version 2.4.0
- BASE: Updated version of DiagnosticSource to 4.4.0 stable

## Version 2.4.0-beta3

## Version 2.4.0-beta2
- BASE: Removed metric aggregation functionality as there is not enough feedback on the API surface yet.

## Version 2.4.0-beta1
- BASE: Event telemetry is set to be sampled separately from all other telemetry types. It potentially can double the bill. The reason for this change is that Events are mostly used for usage analysis and should not be subject to sampling on high load of requests and dependencies. Edit `ApplicationInsights.config` file to revert to the previous behavior.
- BASE: Added dependency on System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticsSource package. It is still possible to use standalone Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.dll to track telemetry.
- BASE: StartOperation starts a new System.Diagnostics.Activity and stores operation context in it. StartOperation overwrites OperationTelemetry.Id set before or during telemetry initialization for the dependency correlation purposes.
- BASE: OperationCorrelationTelemetryInitializer initializes telemetry from the Activity.Current. Please refer to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/src/ActivityUserGuide.md for more details about Activity and how to use it
- BASE: `Request.Success` field will not be populated based on `ResponseCode`. It needs to be set explicitly.
- BASE: New "ProblemId" property on ExceptionTelemetry. It can be used to set a custom ProblemId value.
- BASE: Metric Aggregation functionality (originally added in 2.3.0-beta1 but removed in 2.3.0) is re-introduced.

- BASE: Fire new ETW events for Operation Start/Stop.

## Version 2.3.0-beta2
- BASE: Added constructor overloads for TelemetryConfiguration and added creation of a default InMemoryChannel when no channel is specified for a new instance.
  TelemetryClient will no longer create an InMemoryChannel on the configuration instance if TelemetryChannel is null, instead the configuration instances will always have a channel when created.
- BASE: TelemetryConfiguration will no longer dispose of user provided ITelemetryChannel instances.  Users must properly dispose of any channel instances which they create, the configuration will only auto-dispose of default channel instances it creates when none are specified by the user.

## Version 2.3.0-beta1
- BASE: Added metric aggregation functionality via MetricManager and Metric classes.
- BASE: Exposed a source field on RequestTelemetry. This can be used to store a representation of the component that issued the incoming http request.

- BASE: Context properties `NetworkType`, `ScreenResolution` and `Language` marked as obsolete. Please use custom properties to report network type, screen resolution and language. Values stored in these properties will be send as custom properties.
- BASE: Dependency type was updated to reflect the latest developments in Application Insights Application Map feature. You can set a new field - `Target`. `CommandName` was renamed to `Data` for consistency with the Application Analytics schema. `DependencyKind` will never be send any more and will not be set to "Other" by default. Also there are two more constructors for `DependencyTelemetry` item.
- BASE: Type `SessionStateTelemetry` was marked obsolete. Use `IsFirst` flag in `SessionContext` to indicate that the session is just started.
- BASE: Type `PerformanceCounterTelemetry` was marked obsolete. Use `MetricTelemetry` instead.
- BASE: Marked `RequestTelemetry.HttpMethod` as obsolete. Put http verb as part of the name for the better grouping by name and use custom properties to report http verb as a dimension.

- BASE: [Added support for SDK-side throttling](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-dotnet/issues/318)

## Version 2.2.0-beta2

- BASE: InMemoryChannel has a new override for Flush method that accepts timeout.
- BASE: Local storage folder name was changed. That means that when the application stopped, and the application was updated to the new SDK, then the telemetry from the old local folder will not be send.
- BASE: Allow all characters in property names and measurements names.
- BASE: AdaptiveTelemetryProcessor has a new property IncludedTypes. It gets or sets a semicolon separated list of telemetry types that should be sampled. If left empty all types are included implicitly. Types are not included if they are set in ExcludedTypes.
- BASE: Richpayload event source event is generated for all framework versions of SDK (before it was supported in 4.6 only)
- BASE: TelemetryClient has a new method TrackAvailability. Data posted using this method would be available in AppAnalitics only, Azure portal UI is not available at this moment.

## Version 2.2.0-beta1

- BASE: Add ExceptionTelemetry.Message property. If it is provided it is used instead of Exception.Message property for the outer-most exception.
- BASE: Telemetry types can be excluded from sampling by specifing ExcludedTypes property.
- BASE: ServerTelemetryChannel: changed backoff logic to be less aggressive, added diagnostics event when backoff logic kicks in and added more tracing. (Done to address issues when data stops flowing till application gets restarted)

## Version 2.1.0-beta4
- BASE: [Bug fix](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-dotnet-server/issues/76)

## Version 2.1.0-beta3

- BASE: Bug fixes

## Version 2.1.0-beta1

- BASE: Upgraded to depend on EventSource.Redist nuget version 1.1.28
- BASE: Upgraded to depend on Microsoft.Bcl nuget version 1.1.10

## Version 2.0.1

- BASE: Add Win Phone, Win Store and UWP targets that include 1.2.3 version of ApplicationInsights.dll. It is included to prevent applications that upgrade to 2.0.0 from crashing. In any case using this nuget for Win Phone, Win Store and UWP targets is not recommended and not supported.

## Version 2.0.0

- BASE: Disallow Nan, +-Infinity measurements. Value will be replaced on 0.
- BASE: Disallow Nan, +-Infinity metrics (Value, Min, Max and StandardDeviation). Values will be replaced on 0.

## Version 2.0.0-rc1

- BASE: Writing telemetry items to debug output can be disabled with ```IsTracingDisabled``` property on ```TelemetryDebugWriter```.
Telemetry items that were filtered out by sampling are now indicated in debug output. Custom telemetry processors can now invoke
method ```WriteTelemetry``` on ```TelemetryDebugWriter``` with ```filteredBy``` parameter to indicate in debug output that an
item is being filtered out.
- BASE: DependencyTelemetry.Async property was removed.
- BASE: DependencyTelemetry.Count property was removed.
- BASE: When configuration is loaded from ApplicationInsights.config incorrect and broken elements are skipped. That includes both high level elements like TelemetryInitializers as well as individual properties.

- BASE: Cut Phone and Store support
- BASE: Updated ```DependencyTelemetry``` to have new properties ```ResultCode``` and ```Id```
- BASE: If ``ServerTelemetryChannel`` is initialized programmatically it is required to call ServerTelemetryChannel.Initialize() method. Otherwise persistent storage will not be initialized (that means that if telemetry cannot be sent because of temporary connectivity issues it will be dropped).
- BASE: ``ServerTelemetryChannel`` has new property ``StorageFolder`` that can be set either through code or though configuration. If this property is set ApplicationInsights uses provided location to store telemetry that was not sent because of temporary connectivity issues. If property is not set or provided folder is inaccessible ApplicationInsights will try to use LocalAppData or Temp as it was done before.
- BASE: TelemetryConfiguration.GetTelemetryProcessorChainBuilder extension method is removed. Instead of this method use TelemetryConfiguration.TelemetryProcessorChainBuilder instance method.
- BASE: TelemetryConfiguration has a new property TelemetryProcessors that gives readonly access to TelemetryProcessors collection.
- BASE: `Use`, `UseSampling` and `UseAdaptiveSampling` preserves TelemetryProcessors loaded from configuration.

- BASE: Fixed signature of ```UseSampling``` to allow chaining with other calls to ```Use``` of telemetry processors.
- BASE: Property ```Request.ID``` returned back. ```OperationContext``` now has a property ```ParentId``` for end-to-end correlation.
- BASE: ```TimestampTelemetryInitializer``` is removed. Timestamp will be added automatically by ```TelemetryClient```.
- BASE: ```OperationCorrelationTelemetryInitializer``` is added by default to enable operaitons correlation.

## Version 2.0.0-beta2
- BASE: Fix UI thread locking when initializing InMemoryChannel (default channel) from UI thread.
- BASE: Added support for ```ITelemetryProcessor``` and ability to construct chain of TelemetryProcessors via code or config.
- BASE: Version of ```Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.dll``` for the framework 4.6 is now part of the package.

- BASE: Property ```Id``` of ```RequestTelemetry``` was removed.
- BASE: Property ```Id``` and ```Context.Operation.Id``` of ```RequestTelemetry``` would not be initialized when creating new ```RequestTelemetry```.
- BASE: New properties of ```OperationContext```: ```CorrelationVector```, ```ParentId``` and ```RootId``` to support end-to-end telemetry items correlation.

## Version 2.0.0-beta1

- BASE: TrackDependency will produce valid JSON when not all required fields were specified.
- BASE: Redundant property ```RequestTelemetry.ID``` is now just a proxy for ```RequestTelemetry.Operation.Id```.

- BASE: First version shipped from github

## Version 1.1

- BASE: SDK now introduces new telemetry type ```DependencyTelemetry``` which contains information about dependency call from application
- BASE: New method ```TelemetryClient.TrackDependency``` allows to send information about dependency calls from application

## Version 0.17

- BASE: Application Insights now distributes separate binaries for framework 4.0 and 4.5. Library for the framework 4.5 will not require EventSource and BCL nuget dependencies. You need to ensure you refer the correct library in ```packages.config```. It should be ```<package id="Microsoft.ApplicationInsights" version="0.17.*" targetFramework="net45" />```
- BASE: Diagnostics telemetry module is not registered in ApplicationInsights.config and no self-diagnostics messages will be sent to portal for non-web applications. Insert ```<Add Type="Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility.Implementation.Tracing.DiagnosticsTelemetryModule, Microsoft.ApplicationInsights" />``` to ```<TelemetryModules>``` node to get SDK self-diagnostics messages from your application.
- BASE: ApplicationInsights.config file search order was changed. File from the bin/ folder will no longer be used even if exists for the web applications.
- BASE: Nullable properties are now supported in ApplicationInsights.config.
- BASE: DeveloperMode property of ```ITelemetryChannel``` interface became a nullable bool.

## Version 0.16

- BASE: SDK now supports dnx target platform to enable monitoring of [.NET Core framework](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/NETCore5) applications.
- BASE: Instance of ```TelemetryClient``` do not cache Instrumentation Key anymore. Now if instrumentation key wasn't set to ```TelemetryClient``` explicitly ```InstrumentationKey``` will return null. It fixes an issue when you set ```TelemetryConfiguration.Active.InstrumentationKey``` after some telemetry was already collected, telemetry modules like dependency collector, web requests data collection and performance counters collector will use new instrumentation key.

## Version 0.15

- BASE: New property ```Operation.SyntheticSource``` now available on ```TelemetryContext```. Now you can mark your telemetry items as not a real user traffic and specify how this traffic was generated. As an example by setting this property you can distinguish traffic from your test automation from load test traffic.
- BASE: Channel logic was moved to the separate NuGet called Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.PersistenceChannel. Default channel is now called InMemoryChannel
- BASE: New method ```TelemetryClient.Flush``` allows to flush telemetry items from the buffer synchronously

## Version 0.13

No release notes for older versions available.

- WEB: [Fix double correlation header injection with latest DiagnosticSource](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-dotnet-server/issues/530)
- WEB: `DisableDiagnosticSourceInstrumentation` configuration flag was added to `DependencyTrackingTelemetryModule`.
  * By default `DisableDiagnosticSourceInstrumentation` is set to false, this enables correlation of telemetry items and [application map](http://aka.ms/AiAppMapPreview) in multi-tier applications.
  * When `DisableDiagnosticSourceInstrumentation` is set to true (so that the instrumentation is off)
    * correlation between requests, dependencies, and other telemetry items is limited,
    * telemetry correlation between multiple services involved in the operation processing is not possible,
    * and the cross-component correlation feature and application map experience is limited.
  * **Note**: this configuration option has no effect for applications that run in an Azure Web Application with the [ApplicationInsights site extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-insights/app-insights-azure-web-apps) or have [runtime instrumentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home/tree/master/Samples/AzureEmailService/WorkerRoleA#report-dependencies).

- WEB: Cross Components Correlation ID changed from SHA(instrumentation key) to Application ID retrieved from http endpoint `api/profiles/{ikey}/appId`.

## Version 2.3.0-beta2
- WEB: Automatic collection of first chance exceptions statistics. Use a query like this in Application Analytics to query for this statistics:
  ```
  customMetrics
  | where timestamp > ago(5d)
  | where name == "Exceptions thrown"

- WEB: Support of performance collection and live metrics for Azure Web Apps is enabled.

## Version 2.2.0-beta3
- WEB: New property `DefaultCounters` in `PerformanceCollectorModule` to control the list of standard counters that will be collected
- WEB: Default performance counters will be reported as metrics
- WEB: When you instantiate `DependencyTrackingTelemetryModule` in code it will not detect certain http dependencies as Azure Storage calls. You need to register a telemetry initializer `HttpDependenciesParsingTelemetryInitializer` to enable this functionality. This telemetry initializer will be registered automatically during NuGet installation.
- WEB: DependencyCollection nuget package was updated to Agent.Intercept nuget version 2.0.5.
- WEB: The list of userAgent substrings that indicate that traffic is from a synthetic source was minimized for performance reasons. If you want to include more substrings please add them under SyntheticUserAgentTelemetryInitializer/Filters. (List of filters that were used before is saved as a comment in the configuration file)

- WEB: Upgraded to depend on Microsoft.Bcl nuget version 1.1.10
- WEB: LiveMetricsStream feature is introduced (Not surfaced in UI yet)

## Version 2.0.0
- WEB: Performance counter collection is no longer supported when running under IIS Express.

## Version 2.0.0-rc1

**Dependencies:**

- WEB: Http dependency success is determined on the base of http status code. Before it was true if there was no exception. But when one uses HttpClient there is no exceptions so all dependencies were marked as successful. Also in case if response is not available status code was set to -1. Now now status code will be reported.

## Version 2.0.0-beta4

**Web:**

- WEB: WebApps AlwaysOn requests with ResponseCode less than 400 will be filtered out.
- WEB: User agent and request handler filters can be configured. Previous behavior filtered out only a default set of request handlers and user agent strings,
  now custom filters can be added to the ApplicationInsights.config file through the ```TelemetryProcessors``` section.
  Telemetry for requests with HttpContext.Current that matches these filters will not be sent.
- WEB: If multiple simultaneous calls are made on a ```SqlCommand``` object, only one dependency is recorded. The second
  call will be failed immediately by ```SqlCommand``` and will not be recorded as a dependency.

## Version 2.0.0-beta3
**Web:**

- WEB: Use ```OperationCorrelationTelemetryInitializer``` instead of ```OperationIdTelemetryInitializer```
- WEB: User Agent and Client IP will not be collected by default. User Agent telemetry initializer was removed
- WEB: ```DependencyTelemetry.Async``` field will not be collected by dependency collector telemetry module
- WEB: Static content and diagnostics requests will not be collected by request telemetry module. Use ```HandlersToFilter``` of ```RequestTrackingTelemetryModule``` collection to filter out requests generated by certain http handlers
- WEB: Autogenerated request telemetry is accessible though HttpContext extension method: System.Web.HttpContextExtension.GetRequestTelemetry

## Version 2.0.0-beta2
**Web:**

- WEB: RequestTelemetry.Name is not initialized any longer. RequestTelemetry.Context.Operaiton.Name will be used instead.
- WEB: Response code 401 is part of the normal authentication handshake and will result in a succesfull request.

**WindowsServer**

- WEB: DeviceTelemetryInitializer is not installed by default any more.

## Version 2.0.0-beta1

**Web:**

- WEB: Added `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Web.AccountIdTelemetryInitializer`, `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Web.AuthenticatedUserIdTelemetryInitializer` that initialize authenticated user context as set by Javascript SDK.
- WEB: Added `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WindowsServer.TelemetryChannel.ITelemetryProcessor` and fixed-rate Sampling support as an implementation of it.
- WEB: Added `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WindowsServer.TelemetryChannel.TelemetryChannelBuilder` that allows creation of a `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WindowsServer.TelemetryChannel.ServerTelemetryChannel` with a set of `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WindowsServer.TelemetryChannel.ITelemetryProcessor`.

## Version 1.2.0
**Web:**

- WEB: Telemetry initializers that do not have dependencies on ASP.NET libraries were moved to the new dependency nuget "Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WindowsServer"
- WEB: Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Web.dll was renamed on Microsoft.AI.Web.dll
- WEB: Microsoft.Web.TelemetryChannel nuget was renamed on Microsoft.WindowsServer.TelemetryChannel. TelemetryChannel assembly was also renamed.
- WEB: All namespaces that are part of Web SDK were changed to exlude "Extensibility" part. That incudes all telemetry initializers in applicationinsights.config and ApplicationInsightsWebTracking module in web.config.

**Dependencies:**

- WEB: Dependencies collected using runtime instrumentaiton agent (enabled via Status Monitor or Azure WebSite extension) will not be marked as asynchronous if there are no HttpContext.Current on the thread.
- WEB: Property ```SamplingRatio``` of ```DependencyTrackingTelemetryModule``` does nothing and marked as obsolete.

**Performance Counters**

- WEB: Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility.PerfCounterCollector assembly was renamed on Microsoft.AI.PerfCounterCollector

**WindowsServer**

- WEB: First version of the package. The package has common logic that will be shared between Web and Non-Web Windows applications.

## Version 1.0.0

**Web:**

- WEB: Moved telemetry initializers and telemetry modules from separate sub-namespaces to the root
  `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility.Web` namespace.
- WEB: Removed "Web" prefix from names of telemetry initializers and telemetry modules because it is already included in the
  `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility.Web` namespace name.
- WEB: Moved `DeviceContextInitializer` from the `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights` assembly to the
  `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility.Web` assembly and converted it to an `ITelemetryInitializer`.

**Dependencies:**

- WEB: Change namespace and assembly names from `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility.RuntimeTelemetry` to
  `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility.DependencyCollector` for consistency with the name of the NuGet package.
- WEB: Rename `RemoteDependencyModule` to `DependencyTrackingTelemetryModule`.

**Performance Counters**

- WEB: Rename 'CustomPerformanceCounterCollectionRequest' to 'PerformanceCounterCollectionRequest'.

## Version 0.17

**Web:**

- WEB: Removed dependency to EventSource NuGet for the framework 4.5 applications.
- WEB: Anonymous User and Session cookies will not be generated on server side. Telemetry modules ```WebSessionTrackingTelemetryModule``` and ```WebUserTrackingTelemetryModule``` are no longer supported and were removed from ApplicationInsights.config file. Cookies from JavaScript SDK will be respected.
- WEB: Persistence channel optimized for high-load scenarios is used for web SDK. "Spiral of death" issue fixed. Spiral of death is a condition when spike in telemetry items count that greatly exceeds throttling limit on endpoint will lead to retry after certain time and will be throttled during retry again.
- WEB: Developer Mode is optimized for production. If left by mistake it will not cause as big overhead as before attempting to output additional information.
- WEB: Developer Mode by default will only be enabled when application is under debugger. You can override it using ```DeveloperMode``` property of  ```ITelemetryChannel``` interface.

**Dependencies:**

- WEB: Removed dependency to EventSource NuGet for the framework 4.5 applications.

**Performance Counters**

- WEB: Diagnostic messages pertaining to performance counter collection are now merged into a single unified message that is logged at application start-up. Detailed failure information is still available through PerfView.

## Version 0.15

**Web:**

- WEB: Application Insights Web package now detects the traffic from Availability monitoring of Application Insights and marks it with specific ```SyntheticSource``` property.

## Version 0.13

No release notes for older versions available.
